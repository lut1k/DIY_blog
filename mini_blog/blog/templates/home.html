    <div>If you’re thinking of starting your very own blog, but just don’t have a clue on what to blog about, then fear not!
        In this article, I have included a whole load of blog examples from a wide variety of different niches.
        Since the beginning of the internet, millions and millions and millions of blogs have been created. Many have
        died due to lost interest or their owners giving up on the idea, while others have thrived and continue to grow,
        making money and earning their owners a steady income. It’s a constant evolution of content that keeps people
        coming back for more, especially if these blogs contact highly resourceful material that people find useful and
        interesting. Each example listed in this blog post are all different in some way and all bring something unique
        to their readers & subscribers. I want to show you what is possible and how you can take inspiration from them
        and create an awesome blog of your own. Some of these blogs make over $100k a month, others are just a hobby for
        their owners, but all have the same purpose at their core… the love of writing and sharing information.
        Remember that it doesn’t cost the earth to start your own blog. You can be up and running for as little as $1.45
        per month with Hostinger. Bluehost offer web hosting, Free SSL, Email, web builder and a FREE DOMAIN for as little as $2.95 a month.
